# Black Ops 1: Zombies EE patches (Game_Mod Compatible)

These patches enable the ability to complete the Easter eggs in solo or with any amount of players (no steps are skipped) and will unlock achievements upon completion. Full instructions and changes included in the mod is available on the [releases](https://github.com/ReubenUKGB/black-ops-one-zombies-ee-patches/releases/tag/v1.1.3-black-ops-one-zombies-ee-patches-game_mod_compatible) section.

**Note:** This version of the mod requires [Game_Mod](https://github.com/Nukem9/LinkerMod/releases/tag/v1.3.2) for Black Ops 1 in order to run, but it also works with [Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw/).

**Ascension EE Changes:**
The Casimir Mechanism Easter egg now works with any amount of players, the buttons step now gives players 100 seconds to press all 4 buttons when not in a 4 player game, the lunar lander step is solo-able (the LUNA letters are at their original positions in coop) after the pressure plate step (in order: ride the lander near the Revive perk to grab the letter L, ride the lander near the Stamin-Up perk to grab the letter U, ride the lander near the Speed-Cola perk to grab the letter N and ride the lander near the PhD perk to grab the letter A) and the freeing Gersh step only requires the upgraded Zeus Cannon, upgraded Ray Gun and Gersh Device when playing solo.

**Call of the Dead EE Changes:**
The co-op version of the Ensemble Cast Easter egg now works in solo, you no longer have to knife the frozen vodka bottle, you can shoot at the ice encased around it to dislodge it whilst standing below it to catch it in solo, when in co-op the ice encased around the vodka bottle needs to be knifed.

**Shangri-La EE Changes:**
The Time Travel Will Tell Easter egg now works with any amount of players and in solo mode the tile matching step now gives the player 100 seconds to match each tile before they reset (standing on the tile activates the timer and symbol so that you can match tiles, crouching on the tile clears the symbol and stops the timer so that you can memorise which symbols are on what tiles) and time in eclipse mode has been increased to 20 minutes during the tile matching step (player 1 always spawns as Richtofen).

**Moon EE Changes:**
The Richtofen's Grand Scheme Easter egg now works with any amount of players and still requires the completion of previous Easter eggs (player 1 always spawns as Richtofen).
