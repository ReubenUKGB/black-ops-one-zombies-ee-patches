# Black Ops 1: Zombies EE patches (Steam compatible)

This version of the mod works with the Steam version of the game.

**How to install:**</br>
Download the appropriate file from the [releases](https://github.com/ReubenUKGB/black-ops-one-zombies-ee-patches/releases) section, then extract and copy the .ff files to the _"steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops\zone\Common"_ folder.

**How to uninstall:**</br>
Verify the integrity of game files for _Call of Duty: Black Ops_ and _Call of Duty: Black Ops - Multiplayer_.

**Known bugs:**
- The Mule Kick perk is bugged and doesn't work properly.

**Ascension:**</br>
The Casimir Mechanism Easter egg now works with any amount of players, the buttons step now gives players 100 seconds to press all 4 buttons when not in a 4 player game, the lunar lander step is solo-able (the LUNA letters are at their original positions in coop) after the pressure plate step (in order: ride the lander near the Revive perk to grab the letter L, ride the lander near the Stamin-Up perk to grab the letter U, ride the lander near the Speed-Cola perk to grab the letter N and ride the lander near the PhD perk to grab the letter A) and the freeing Gersh step only requires the upgraded Zeus Cannon, upgraded Ray Gun and Gersh Device when playing solo.

**Call of the Dead:**</br>
The co-op version of the Ensemble Cast Easter egg now works in solo, you no longer have to knife the frozen vodka bottle, you can shoot at the ice encased around it to dislodge it whilst standing below it to catch it in solo, when in co-op the ice encased around the vodka bottle needs to be knifed.

**Shangri-La:**</br>
The Time Travel Will Tell Easter egg now works with any amount of players and in solo mode the tile matching step now gives the player 100 seconds to match each tile before they reset (standing on the tile activates the timer and symbol so that you can match tiles, crouching on the tile clears the symbol and stops the timer so that you can memorise which symbols are on what tiles) and time in eclipse mode has been increased to 20 minutes during the tile matching step (player 1 always spawns as Richtofen).

**Moon:**</br>
The Richtofen's Grand Scheme Easter egg now works with any amount of players and still requires the completion of previous Easter eggs (player 1 always spawns as Richtofen).

**Optional:** Compile from source using Call of Duty: Black Ops - Mod Tools (BETA): [steam://install/42740](steam://install/42740)
