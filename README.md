# Black Ops 1: Zombies EE patches
Mods for the Zombies maps: Ascension, Call of the Dead, Shangri-La & Moon. These patches enable the ability to complete the Easter eggs in solo or with any amount of players and will unlock achievements upon completion.

These mods work with any version of Black Ops 1, Game_Mod and Plutonium compatibility soon.

To install, download the .zip files from the [releases](https://github.com/ReubenUKGB/black-ops-one-zombies-ee-patches/releases) section and extract the files to "steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops\zone\Common"

# Optional: Compile from source using the Call of Duty: Black Ops - Mod Tools (BETA): steam://install/42740

For more info about this mod, such as the steps to complete the Easter eggs (they're as close to the original steps as possible when there's less than four players present), read the associated Steam [guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3041320930).
