# Black Ops 1: Zombies EE patches

These mods work with any version of Black Ops 1, Game_Mod and Plutonium compatibility soon.

To install, download the files from the [releases](https://github.com/ReubenUKGB/black-ops-one-zombies-ee-patches/releases) section and copy the files (extract first if downloading the all-in-one .zip file) to "steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops\zone\Common"

**Ascension:**</br>
The Casimir Mechanism Easter egg now works with any amount of players, the button sychronisation step now gives players one-hundred seconds to press all four buttons when not in a four player game, the lander step is solo-able (the LUNA letters are at there original positions in coop) after the pressure plate step (in order: ride the lander near the Revive perk to grab the letter L, ride the lander near the Stamin-Up perk to grab the letter U, ride the lander near the Speed-Cola perk to grab the letter N and ride the lander near the PhD perk to grab the letter A) and the freeing Gersh step only requires the upgraded Zeus Cannon, upgraded Ray Gun and Gersh Device when playing solo.

**Call of the Dead:**</br>
The co-op version of the Ensemble Cast Easter egg now works in solo, you no longer have to knife the frozen vodka bottle, you can shoot at the ice encased around it to dislodge it whilst standing below it to catch it in solo, when in co-op the ice encased aroubnd the vodka bottle needs to be knifed.

**Shangri-La:**</br>
The Time Travel Will Tell Easter egg now works with any amount of players and in solo mode the tile matching step now gives the player 100 seconds to match each tile before they reset (standing on the tile activates the timer and symbol so that you can match tiles, crouching on the tile clears the symbol and stops the timer so that you can memorise which symbols are on what tiles) and time in eclipse mode has been increased to 20 minutes during the tile matching step (the player always spawns as Richtofen when playing solo).

**Moon:**</br>
The Richtofen's Grand Scheme Easter egg now works with any amount of players, still requires the completion of previous Easter eggs and someone must spawn as Richtofen in the game (the player always spawns as Richtofen when playing solo).

**Optional:** Compile from source using Call of Duty: Black Ops - Mod Tools (BETA): [steam://install/42740](steam://install/42740)
