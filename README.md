# Black Ops 1: Zombies EE patches

These mods work with any version of Black Ops 1, Game_Mod and Plutonium compatibility soon.

To install, download the files from the [releases](https://github.com/ReubenUKGB/black-ops-one-zombies-ee-patches/releases) section and copy the files (extract first if downloading the all-in-one .zip file) to "steamapps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops\zone\Common"

**Optional:** Compile from source using Call of Duty: Black Ops - Mod Tools (BETA): [steam://install/42740](steam://install/42740)

**Ascension:**
It now works with any amount of players, the synchronised buttons step now gives players one-hundred seconds to press all four buttons when not in a four player game, the lander step is solo-able (the LUNA letters are at there original positions in coop) after the pressure plate step (in order: ride the lander near the Revive perk to grab the letter L, ride the lander near the Stamin-Up perk to grab the letter U, ride the lander near the Speed-Cola perk to grab the letter N and ride the lander near the PhD perk to grab the letter A) and the freeing Gersh step only requires the upgraded Zeus Cannon, upgraded Ray Gun and Gersh Device when playing solo.
